[osu!gaming CTF 2025](https://osugaming.sekai.team/) launches this weekend, 25th October, for a 48-hour competition! Whether you've never heard of a CTF before or are a veteran hacker, here's everything you need to know about participating in this unique mishmash.

## What is a CTF?

[Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)) are information security exercises where participants solve a series of challenges to find hidden text strings called "flags". Each solved challenge reveals a secret code that, when submitted, earns your team points on a global leaderboard.

In the [Jeopardy!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!)-style format used by CTFs, challenges are designed to be sorted into various categories, each of which test different skills. Traditional CTF categories include the following:

- **Web exploitation** challenges involve finding vulnerabilities in web applications.
- **Cryptography** challenges involve breaking codes, ciphers and encryption schemes.
- **Reverse engineering** challenges involve analysing compiled programmes to understand their behaviour.
- **Forensics** challenges involve analysing files and data to uncover hidden information.
- **Binary exploitation** challenges involve manipulating compiled programmes to achieve a desired outcome.
- **Miscellaneous** challenges are creative challenges that don't fit traditional categories.

If technical puzzle-solving sounds interesting, but you've never participated in one of these yourself, no worries! The challenges are designed to accommodate both beginners and experienced players alike.

## Interesting, but where does osu! come in?

While traditional CTFs feature standard cybersecurity challenges, **every challenge in this event is themed around osu! and/or popular rhythm games**! In addition to the categories mentioned in the previous section, we add two more:

- Challenges with the tag **osu!** involve knowledge of the game's ecosystems or interaction with its components.
- Challenges with the tag **rhythm** involve knowledge of other popular (or not so popular) rhythm games or interaction with their game components.

These are the categories where rhythm gamers have the advantage! This means you can definitely gain points just with osu! players in your team, but you'll learn a lot more from each other if your team has expertise from many different areas.

Also, note that none of the solutions involve interacting with online systems (unless they're created by us!), such as public chat/forums or game/website infrastructure, meaning you can use that to narrow down your search... but that's it for general tips! The [event website](https://osugaming.sekai.team/) will contain all the challenges and information you need to get started.
